# 42_Libft

"Libft" is a project that focuses on creating a custom library of useful functions in the C programming language. The project aims to provide a comprehensive set of functions that can be used as a foundation for other projects or to enhance the functionality of existing C programs.

The repository contains the source code and necessary files for the Libft library. The library includes various functions for string manipulation, memory management, character handling, and other common operations. By using this library, developers can save time by utilizing pre-implemented functions instead of writing them from scratch.
